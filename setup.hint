ldesc: "Mp3blaster is an mp3 player for computers running a UNIX-like 
operating system, Its interface is entirely text based, thereby 
eliminating the need for a graphical environment like X-Windows. This 
does not limit the way you can control the player whilst playing though; 
just like any graphical mp3 player, there are cd-style buttons like 
play, stop, pause, next track, etc."
